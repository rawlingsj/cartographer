# `app-deploy` instantiates a `App` which applies configuration from a ConfigMap.
#
# The use of `App` here is important because of how `knative` updates the
# knative service under the hood to include some extra annotations that _can't_
# be mutated once applied by knative's controller. As `kapp` is able to be
# configured to not patch certain features (something `cartographer` can't
# yet), we're able to bridge that gap with the use of `kapp-ctrl/App`.
#
# This template does not directly accept inputs but instead looks for a ConfigMap with name matching that of the Workload.
